## 💻 C Programming – 7 Days Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **C Programming Practice Repository**!  
This repository contains all my learning and practice from **Day 1 to Day 7**, where I explored every major concept of C programming — from basics to advanced topics — with **examples and exercises** each day.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 1 – Basics of C** 🥇
📘 **Topics Covered:**
- Structure of a C program  
- Data types, variables, constants  
- Input and output using `printf()` and `scanf()`  
- Operators and expressions  
- Example programs: addition, subtraction, area of shapes, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Build a strong foundation and understand how a C program runs.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 2 – Conditional & Looping Statements** 🔁
🧮 **Topics Covered:**
- Conditional statements: `if`, `if-else`, `nested if`, `switch`  
- Looping: `for`, `while`, `do-while`  
- Break and continue usage  
- Example programs: even/odd check, factorial, Fibonacci series, patterns, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Control the program flow using decision making and repetition.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 3 – Functions & Pointers** 🧭
⚙️ **Topics Covered:**
- Declaring and defining functions  
- Function arguments and return types  
- Recursive functions  
- Introduction to pointers and memory addresses  
- Call by value and call by reference  
- Example programs: swapping using functions, factorial using recursion, pointer operations, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Write modular and reusable code using functions and pointers.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 4 – Arrays** 📊
🧠 **Topics Covered:**
- Single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays  
- Array traversal and manipulation  
- Finding sum, maximum, and minimum elements  
- Matrix operations  
- Example programs: array sum, reverse, sorting, matrix addition/multiplication, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Learn how to store and access large sets of data efficiently.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 5 – Strings** ✍️
🔤 **Topics Covered:**
- Declaring and initializing strings  
- Common string functions: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcmp`, `strcat`  
- String traversal and manipulation  
- Example programs: palindrome check, string reverse, counting words/vowels, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Handle and manipulate text efficiently in C.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 6 – Files, Structures & Dynamic Memory Allocation** 📂
📗 **Topics Covered:**
- File handling: `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, `fclose`  
- Working with structures (`struct`)  
- Dynamic memory allocation: `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free`  
- Example programs: reading/writing files, student record system, dynamic array creation, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Learn how to manage data efficiently and handle memory dynamically.

---

## 🗓️ **Day 7 – Practice Questions & Mini Programs** 🧩
🧑‍💻 **Topics Covered:**
- Mixed practice from all previous topics  
- Combination programs using arrays, strings, and functions  
- Debugging and optimization practice  
- Example programs: menu-driven projects, logical challenges, file-based tasks, etc.

💡 *Goal:* Revise all concepts and strengthen programming logic through practice.
